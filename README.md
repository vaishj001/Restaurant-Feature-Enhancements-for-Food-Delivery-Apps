# ðŸ“Š **Restaurant Feature Enhancements for Food Delivery Apps**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

Food delivery apps face key challenges in **streamlining user decision-making, ensuring fair visibility for restaurants, and incentivizing sustainable dining choices**. Users often struggle to find the right restaurant quickly, while smaller and local businesses lack visibility compared to larger chains. Additionally, there is limited motivation for users to opt for eco-conscious dining options, despite growing demand.

### **Key Features & Enhancements**

âœ… **Mood-Based Filtering** â†’ Simplifies restaurant discovery by categorizing options based on user preferences and dining context.\
âœ… **Fair Visibility Ranking** â†’ Implements a **60:40 ranking model** to ensure local and independent restaurants receive equitable exposure.\
âœ… **Green Points Gamification** â†’ Encourages sustainable dining choices by awarding points for selecting eco-friendly restaurants.

These enhancements improve **customer experience, restaurant engagement, and sustainability adoption**, making the food delivery platform more intuitive, equitable, and environmentally conscious.
